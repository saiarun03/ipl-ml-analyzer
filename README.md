# 🏏 IPL Cricket Analytics & Prediction (2008–2016)

## 📌 Overview
This project applies **data analytics** and **machine learning** to Indian Premier League (IPL) data (2008–2016).  
Using ball-by-ball and match-level records, the project delivers insights into **teams, players, and match outcomes**, while also building **predictive models** to forecast results.  

### Key Objectives
- 📊 Perform **analytics** on players, teams, venues, and seasons.  
- 🤖 Build **machine learning models** to predict:  
  - Match winners (classification).  
  - Team final score after powerplay overs (regression).  
- 🎯 Identify **player archetypes** using clustering (anchors, finishers, all-rounders, bowlers).  
- 📈 Present insights with clear visualizations and a Streamlit dashboard.
